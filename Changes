0.331   2019-01-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	  system({shell=>1}, 'ls', '-laR', \'>', '/root/ls-laR.txt').

	- Add tests for tee_* options.


0.330   2017-08-10  Released-By: PERLANCAR

0.28    2016-10-06  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Enhancement] Add option: chdir.

        - Die when supplied unknown options.

        - [Bugfix] Avoid the use of defined-or (//) as this requires perl v5.10.

        - [test] Add test suite.


0.27    2016-06-08  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Rename backtick() to readpipe() to allow overriding the
	  backtick/qx operator (the old name has been deprecated and
	  removed from doc but still supported for now).


0.26    2016-06-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [doc] Mention quoting of multiple arguments and proper quoting on
	  Win32.


0.25    2016-06-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - When converting multiple arguments to string, shell quote the
          arguments (e.g. backtick('foo', 'bar baz') or system({shell=>1},
          'foo', 'bar baz') will become "foo 'bar baz'". But single argument
          will not be shell-quoted, e.g. backtick('foo "bar baz"') will not be
          shell-quoted again.

        - Support Win32 shell quoting using Win32::ShellQuote.


0.24    2016-01-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Avoid using Carp for faster startup.


0.23    2015-09-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add run(), first written for use in Test::Perinci::CmdLine because I
          need something like IPC::System::Options' system() (with
          capture_stdout, capture_stderr, env, etc) but also allows passing
          stdin (which system() does not support).


0.22    2015-09-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Bump prereq Log::Any::IfLOG to version 0.07 (uses get_logger())
	  [RT#107051].

        - No functional changes.

        - Re-upload to PAUSE.


0.18    2015-07-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Bugfix] Allow import() to be used by other package, e.g.
          IPC::System::Locale, by exporting the correct system() and backtick().


0.17    2015-07-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Incompatible change] Replace 'capture' option with separate
	  'capture_stdout' and 'capture_stderr' options to be more flexible
	  (e.g. only capturing stdout and letting stderr show through).


0.16    2015-06-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Third attempt, previous release didn't remove the usage of state
          variable.


0.15    2015-06-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

0.12    2015-06-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Defeat prototype checking (which might be active or not,
	  depending whether Capture::Tiny has previously been loaded during
	  compile time).


0.11    2015-06-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add option: capture.


0.10    2015-05-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [ux] Accept option dies as well as die, but this is not documented.


0.09    2015-04-21  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Degrade Log::Any from RuntimeRequires to RuntimeRecommends, to
	  reduce deps.


0.08    2015-04-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Add option: env.


0.07    2015-04-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- When shell=>1, force the use of shell by concat-ing the args.


0.06    2015-02-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Export import() so it's easier to use by my other IPC::System::*
	  modules.

	- Allow specifying default options during use.


0.04    2015-02-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	  environment).


0.03    2015-01-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Add option: die=>1.

        - Add options: log=>1, max_log_output=>1. This integrates the
          functionality of Log::Any::For::Builtins. I now deprecate that module
          in favor of this.


0.02    2015-01-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add backtick().


0.01     2015-01-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR
